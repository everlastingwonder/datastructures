Data Structures 
Assignment 7

write the implementation of a queue using a
circular 1-d array.  (make it a list of ints)
You will need the following functions:

add()
del()
full() (called by add())
empty()
list()
next()

You probably should make the "list" be a struct with
one field for the list and one field for the "pointer
to the current item (an index into the array)
