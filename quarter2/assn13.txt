Data Structures
Assignment #13

write and implement both verstions of the binary search.
In each version, put a counter that counts the number
of comparisons done.  Even though we would never ever
do this in real life, have the function print the number
of comparisons just before it returns.  Test both functions
several times with the same data and key to show that the
"rememberful" version is actually slower.
