Data Structures
Assignment 6

write and test the implementation of a queue using a
1-d array.  (make it a queue of ints) You will need 
the following functions:

enqueue()
dequeue()
empty()
next()  (shows next item, but does not change stack)

Make sure that you "reset" the array when it moves
to the "end" of the space you allocated for it.
