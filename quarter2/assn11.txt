Data Structures 
Assignment 11

Create a data structure to represent a singly
linked list

write a C function that will split the list in
two.  The function will return 2 pointers (duh)
and take as input a pointer to the list and a
pointer to the node that will be the "split"
point.  It is up to you which list gets the
"middle" node.
