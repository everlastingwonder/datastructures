Data Structures
Assignment #12

Write a program that has a menu driven interface that will
allow a user to "scroll" through a list of poems.  Do this
by creating a doubly linked list where the data in each node
is the filename of the file that contains the poem.  When 
the program starts, it should take a directory name on 
standard input.  Then it should use the system() function
to do an ls of the directory and save the output to a file.
The program should then read the file, putting one filename
in each node.
The choices offered to the user should be:

   display current poem
   display next poem
   display previous poem
   display first poem
   quit
  
Do not show the "display previous poem" if the current
poem is the first poem.  Similarly, do not show the
"display next poem" if the current poem is the last
poem.
To "display" a poem, use the system() function to do
a page command on the file.  You will need to build
the string for the system() function using an sprintf().

Each of you must type in a poem and copy it to my InComing
directory so we can build a data base.  I have one there
already.
