Data Structures 
Assignment 18
Due 2-16-18

Write a program that will read a diagonalized matrix from
a file and store it in a 1-d array with a corresponding
1-d array access table.  You will need to read on the first
line to discover the number of diagonals with data.  The 
program should have a function
that loads the arrays and then a function that writes the
matrix out on standard output in matrix form (ie, it should
look the same as it does in the file)  This program should
work for any size matrix, so you need to figure the size
of the matrix before you allocate the space for the arrays.
If you like, you can write a function that does that...yea,
that sounds like something that would impress Mr. McGowan.
Test your program on the data in the files trimat.dat and
quintmat.dat in the Data directory.
