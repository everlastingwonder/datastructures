Assignment 21
Due 3-27-18

A)  Use the code from section 9.2 (Insert(), GetNode(), TreeSort()) to
    implement a "tree sort" algorithm.  The key field should be a char
    array, so you can test this with names.  

B)  Write and implement a TreeSearch() function that returns a pointer
    to the node containing the specified key.  Have the main function
    build the list, (call the functions in A) and then ask for a key
    and do the search and print the results  (found or not found)
